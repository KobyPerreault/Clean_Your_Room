# Clean-Your_Room

Used Unreal Engine to create a level from a requirements document that was created after consulting with the client. Used Unrealâ€™s blueprint system to spawn an object that when clicked on, would add to the overall score and then destroy the object and spawn another one in a randomized location within the level. This process would repeat until a specified time was reached where the game would stop and show the player's final score. All models and materials were created by me for this project.
